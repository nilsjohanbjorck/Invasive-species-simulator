# Invasive-species-simulator

This code represents the simulator used for simulating the spread of invasive species in our AAAI 2018 paper "Scalable Relaxations of Sparse Packing Constraints: Optimal Biocontrol in Predator-Prey Network". Some additional data, which we are not able to release, is required to run the code for the North Eastern US.
